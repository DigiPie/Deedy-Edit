Deedy-Edit
=========================

A fork of the OpenFonts variant of the [**Deedy-Resume**](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume) **XeTeX** template that retains the one-page, two column approach by [**Debarghya Das**](https://github.com/deedy). 

This re-design is also inspired by the [**cv-chandan**](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cv-chandan/vgynfrhcvsfx) template. In particular, this implementation enables font-awesome support by utilizing the [**fontawesome-LaTeX**](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex) package by [**Xavier Danaux**](https://github.com/xdanaux).

## Motivation

Despite the rising popularity of single-page resumes amongst both recruiters and applicants, there is a distinct lack of LaTeX resume templates that were designed to display content in a single page. While the Deedy-Resume template was sufficient for all intents, this variant implements a few different design choices while also making it more suited for fresh graduates/undergraduates without any research experience.

### List of Changes:
 1. Re-aligned the name to the left to make space for important contact information to be displayed on the right.
 2. Swapped the Lato-Bold and Lato-Hai font assignments for the name to put focus on the first name instead of the surname.
 3. Added option to choose between A4 and Letter sizes.
 4. Added font-awesome icons for important contact details in the header.
 5. Re-ordered left column according to display more recruiter-relevant details on the top.
 6. Slightly increased line spacing for itemized lists.
 7. Included separate sections for professional and other experiences while removing 'Research', 'Publications' and 'Awards' sections. (They are still supported and can be re-added by un-commenting the relevant sections)

## Dependencies

 1. Compiles only with **XeTeX**. (Use **XeLaTeX** if you are using MacTex)
 2. Requires the **OpenType font-awesome ('FontAwesome.otf')** from [**fontawesome-LaTeX package**](https://github.com/xdanaux/fontawesome-latex).
